Code in acceptors.py is outside, as are the files in acceptors and repair (as well as results, by extension), due to new approaches taken in border_pairs.py. The file gen_FSAs is still all of the FSAs generated by Elliot Tuck's code. 

Currently, we are using border_pairs.py, with output to the files adv_pairs{1k, 10k, 100k}.txt.
